Individual Assignment 2 on git merging conflicts 
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like that with version control collaboration is possible in an organized manner. It is also easier to personally track projects with version control.

The most frustrating thing about version control is when there are merge conflicts between team members. It may be easier to fix them if there is only one person editing.
